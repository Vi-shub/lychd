"""Scout revision 4 through native Graph execution and PostgreSQL consent recovery.

Real admission, worker claims, Graph checkpoints, consent decisions, Scout custody,
session settlement and terminal events share a disposable database. Queue publication,
dispatcher/model, Fetch syscalls and the extraction child remain controlled substitutes
from the older node proof. This does not qualify SAQ, network, model-service or sandbox
execution, nor a whole-process restart: the Scout service retains its admitted authority.
